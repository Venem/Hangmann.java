## Hangman.java
This is an implementation of hangman using Java. This project is currently being rewritten to properly use Java's object orientation rather than trying to use it as a normal programming language - which is a terrible idea as discovered through the creation of the old codebase.

To access the older (and worse) codebase, please switch to the "old" branch.

This project is in need of a simple build script which may be coming soon to ease the development and compilation processes.
